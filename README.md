### 1) What aspect of implementation did you find easy,and why?

Since I had use AJAX and JSON in first project and MongoDB in second Project, I found Project 3 easy to understand and implement as it was combination of Project 1 and Project 2.

### 2) What aspect of implementation did you find hard,and why?  

Showing the database value on client browser is easy but showing only one record at time with animation and time interval is tricky.Moreover, displaying only 20 records at time and removing previous rows from table with animation as new record arrives is also tricky.

### 3) If you were to use these technology professionally, what would be your biggest concern?

Displaying 20 rows at time and removing old record as new record arrives need looping concept. If i were to use these technology in professional word, my concern would be using loop concept precisely with minimum line of code and variables.
